# GRIPJAN21-TASK2
My second task as an intern in The Spark Foundation
I have imported all the necessary libraries and then using the 'Elbow Method' i found out the cluster.
And then i using Kmean i fitted the model and thenusing a Scatter plot i visualized it using different colours for different centroids.
